# Classifying-Pet-Images-project
This repository contains code and associated files for the [Intro to Python Project - Classifying Pet Images:](https://github.com/udacity/AIPND-revision/tree/master/intropyproject-classify-pet-images "Classifying Pet Images Project"), part of my AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program.

Principal Objectives
1. Correctly identify which pet images are of dogs (even if breed is misclassified) and which pet images aren't of dogs.
 
2. Correctly classify the breed of dog, for the images that are of dogs.
 
3. Determine which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG), "best" achieve the objectives 1 and 2.
 
4. Consider the time resources required to best achieve objectives 1 and 2, and determine if an alternative solution would have given a "good enough" result, given the amount of time each of the algorithms take to run.

## Dependencies

The file `requirements.txt` describes the minimal dependencies required to run the project.

### pip

To install these dependencies with pip, you can issue `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
